## Introduction

This is Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Term2 MPC Project.
In this project you'll implement Model Predictive Control (MPC) to drive the car around the track.  
The basic idea of MPC is to predict the states of the car by considering the equations of motions of the car and minimizing a cost.  

---

## Model

The model of the MPC is a basic **kinematic model**. Not dynamic model. For more details, refer to [this paper](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/~frborrel/pdfpub/IV_KinematicMPC_jason.pdf).  
The state of the vehicle consists of `x-position`, `y-position`, `psi` (orientation(heading direction)), `v` (velocity), `CTE` (cross-track-eror), `epsi` (orientation error)   
Actuator consists of `steering angle` and `acceleration`.(positive = throttle, negative = brake)
In simulator, MPC predicted trajectory is represented in green, and reference to the vehicle's coordinate is represented in yellow.

### Environment  
  
>Windows 10(x64), i7-4720HQ 2.60GHz, Ipopt-3.12.8  

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Details

### Model

The vehicle model is a kinematic model and these are the equations for the model :

```
x_[t] = x[t-1] + v[t-1] * cos(psi[t-1]) * dt
y_[t] = y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(psi[t-1]) * dt
psi_[t] = psi[t-1] + v[t-1] / Lf * delta[t-1] * dt
v_[t] = v[t-1] + a[t-1] * dt
cte[t] = f(x[t-1]) - y[t-1] + v[t-1] * sin(epsi[t-1]) * dt
epsi[t] = psi[t] - psides[t-1] + v[t-1] * delta[t-1] / Lf * dt
```

### Timestep and Elapsed Duration( N, dt)

N is the number of timesteps in the horizon. dt is how much time elapses between actuations. They are hyperparameters and T(N*dt) should be as large as possible, while dt should be as small as possible.  
To find the appropriate value for N and dt, I tested several values(e.g. N = 7, 10, 15, 20 and corresponding dt value). In my model, N = 10, dt = 0.1 were best values.

### fitting waypoints & latency

The waypoints of the road are given in the global coordinate. So we need to convert it to the vehicle coordinate. After that, the waypoints are fitted with a 3rd order polynomial.

```
for (int i = 0; i < ptsx.size(); ++i) {

	// move to origin and rotate around origin to align with axis
	double shift_x = ptsx[i] - px;
	double shift_y = ptsy[i] - py;

	ptsx[i] = shift_x * cos(0 - psi) - shift_y * sin(0 - psi);
	ptsy[i] = shift_x * sin(0 - psi) + shift_y * cos(0 - psi);
} 
```

In our simulator, there is a latency between actuations commands.(100 ms)  
I considered this latency and the equation is as below.  
 
```
double latency_x = 0 * v * (100 / 1000);
double latency_y = 0;
double latency_psi = 0;
double cte = polyeval(coeffs, 0) - 0;
double epsi = latency_psi - atan(coeffs[1] + 2 * latency_x * coeffs[2] + 3 * pow(latency_x, 2) * coeffs[3]);
```
